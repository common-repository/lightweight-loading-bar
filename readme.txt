### Lightweight Loading Bar

Add a YouTube-style loading bar to your website easily! Extremely lightweight plugin that only adds 810 bytes to your page size. It also does not add anything to your database. Change color, height, and all options of the loading bar a configuration file easily. This style of preloader has a much more minimalist design and is not annoying at all compared to other full screen designs. Because most mobile browsers already have a built in loading bar, we allow you to disable it on devices smaller than 600px by default. This plugin has been tested with WP Rocket and should be fully compatible with other cache plugins as well. Please post bug reports, issues, and feature requests on [WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lightweight-loading-bar) and I will respond ASAP! If you liked the plugin please [rate it](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lightweight-loading-bar/reviews/#new-post)!

### Features

* Tested and fully compatible with caching plugins like WP Rocket
* Easy to use and simple customization.
* Customize loading bar color and height.
* Option to use gradient.
* Option to show loading bar on your login page.
* Set the position of the bar to either top or bottom.
* Responsive and Retina ready.
* Option to hide on mobile devices.
* Extremely small footprint at only 810 bytes.
* Does not add any values to your database.
* Adds code to the footer to prevent render blocking JS/CSS issues.

### NOTE

* Go to /wp-content/plugins/lightweight-loading-bar/config.php for instructions on how to customize the loading bar.

### Coming Soon... A Settings Page!

* This plugin will not be quite as lightweight, but we will be adding a full fledged GUI to the WordPress Admin! The reason it will be a bit slower is because the current setup allows the plugin to get the options directly from the filesystem, whereas if we have a settings page we will store them in a database which takes time to query. If you like this version of the plugin check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/CRIMSON501/Lightweight-Loading-Bar) page where we will respond to issues. If interest in the LITE version continues, we will make a fork and maintain/improve the plugin.
